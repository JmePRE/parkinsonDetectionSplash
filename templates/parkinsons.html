            Parkinson's disease is a brain disorder that leads to shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with walking, balance, and coordination.Older woman and her caregiver

            Parkinson's symptoms usually begin gradually and get worse over time. As the disease progresses, people may have difficulty walking and talking. They may also have mental and behavioral changes, sleep problems, depression, memory difficulties, and fatigue.          </div>

                  Early symptoms of Parkinson's disease are subtle and occur gradually. 
                  Although there is no cure for Parkinson's disease, medicines, surgical treatment, and other therapies can often relieve some symptoms.
                  In fact, it is common to see marked improvement after therapy or medication.

                      Spirography is a standard method to test the presence of Parkinson's symptoms, such as micrographia (reduction of writing dimensions) or tremor, or to study the strategies adopted by patients in order to partially counter their deficit.
                      <br> For example, it can be noted that the spirals of parkinson's patients are of smaller dimensions than that of healthu people.
                      <br><br>Research also suggests that spiral analysis may be more sensitive in detecting early changes in motor performance than the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), which is a clinical standard method for PD assessment.
                   <br><br>Spiral tests have up to an 86% accuracy in Parkinson's diagnosis, and is highly relevant to diagnosis processes as a whole.
